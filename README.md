hey there! I'm Jerrick. I have been scripting on Roblox for maybe 4-5 years.
I know how to do **most** things. There are definitely some things I cannot do, but if there is any documentation on it I will gladly give it a try.

# COMMISSION INFO
I can create easily changeable scripting, debug scripting, whatever.
I cannot do gun systems whatsoever. trust me, it would take me forever to finalize a gun system. 
( I can sell you a previous gun system though. )
I am able to work on already written scripting or create completely new scripts and use/create modules.

I can also create logos or discord channel banners!
## previous work
I have worked on these simple booth games:

https://www.roblox.com/games/8351248417/The-Booth-Plaza-2

and I have worked on some SCP sites:

N/A (they shut down, I worked on the door systems, lockdowns, etc)
Not a lot of notable past work, but that's why I am trying to find jobs! :-)
## commission payment
I can take robux, PayPal USD or Roblox limiteds.

I don't have a minimum payment, anything I get is greatly appreciated unless extremely lowballed.

# Commission terms
I have the right to deny/resign any commission or job with a valid cause.

I will be willing to fix anything broken or bugged after I finish or resign. ( 2 changes maximum )
